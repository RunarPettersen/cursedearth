            "description": "<p>Bran Castle, located in the heart of Transylvania, Romania, is one of the most famous and mysterious castles in the world. Often associated with Bram Stoker’s fictional Count Dracula, the fortress has a long and fascinating history dating back to the 14th century.</p><p>Constructed in 1388, Bran Castle was originally a strategic military fortress, protecting Transylvania from invading forces. Its gothic architecture, with imposing towers and narrow passageways, contributes to its eerie and foreboding atmosphere. While there is no historical evidence that Vlad the Impaler, the real-life figure who inspired Dracula, ever lived in the castle, the connection between Bran Castle and vampire folklore remains strong.</p><p>Today, Bran Castle is a major tourist attraction, drawing visitors from around the world who are intrigued by its chilling past. The castle now serves as a museum, showcasing medieval artifacts, royal collections, and exhibits on the Dracula legend. Visitors can explore its dimly lit corridors, secret staircases, and haunting rooms while taking in breathtaking views of the surrounding Carpathian Mountains.</p><p>Whether you visit for its medieval history or its dark tourism appeal, Bran Castle stands as an enduring symbol of mystery, legend, and the supernatural.</p>",
